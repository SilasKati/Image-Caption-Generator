# Image-Caption-Generator
This is my BTech in CSE final year project.

**Description:** Implementation of an image caption generator presented by Google researchers in their IEEE paper "Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator" which generates a caption based on the things that are present in the image.

Details of my project, documentation and reports are available in the Documents folder.
